            <p>Stale or bad-smelling feed is evidence of spoilage and possible mold contamination. </p>
            <p>Never use feed that is moldy because some molds produce toxins which could cause serious health problems or poor growth. Ducks are extremely sensitive to mold toxins. </p>
            <p>For example, ducks are sensitive to as little as 30 of ppb aflatoxin. Mold toxins can cause damage to the ducksâ€™ digestive organs, liver, kidneys, muscles, and plumage, and can also
                reduce growth and/or reproductive performance.</p>
